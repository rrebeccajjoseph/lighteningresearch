      "content": "Scientists are continually seeking methods to enhance the performance of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and efficient soft-output decoding is paramount for improving accuracy and accelerating operations such as lattice surgery. ### Efficient soft-output evaluation via early-stopping for scalable quantum error correction enables practical decoding with limited resources. The bounded cluster gap method reduces computational complexity by implementing early-stopping techniques during soft output calculation. ### Reduced computational scaling of quantum decoding via bounded and extra-cluster gap techniques enables more practical applications. Researchers developed new techniques for evaluating soft outputs in cluster-based quantum decoders, addressing computational inefficiencies inherent in existing methods. These advancements lay a foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs, crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing and advanced quantum error correction techniques. Researchers have developed more efficient methods for evaluating soft outputs within cluster-based quantum error correction decoders, addressing limitations in existing approaches. This work introduces two novel soft-output techniques, the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap, designed to reduce computational demands and enhance hardware compatibility."
