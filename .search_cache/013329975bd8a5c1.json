      "content": "CRISPR is a genome editing tool that uses the Cas protein to edit genes. CRISPR/Cas9 is a targeted genome editing technology that uses the Cas protein from certain species of bacteria and archaea. Due to the possibility of off-target effects with no way to definitively prevent them, CRISPR\u2019s use in human clinical research has been heavily set back making it nearly impossible to continue progress until this issue has been addressed. CRISPR works by targeting certain sequences of DNA and manually editing them to cure certain diseases, but off-target effects happen when other sequences are unintentionally changed causing major complications (Guo et al., 2023). Fortunately, through continued research, these problems are being solved through new developments like *in silico* tools which can find off-target effects and improved viral delivery services that prevent continued gene editing. Off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Latest Developed Strategies to Minimize the Off-Target Effects in CRISPR-Cas-Mediated Genome Editing."

By contrast, the 2018 Nuffield Council on Bioethics Report does not seem to limit the uses of genome editing to specific applications, though suggests that applications should be aligned with fundamental guiding ethical principles and need to have followed public debate (Savulescu et al., 2015 The moral imperative to continue gene editing research on human embryos. Nevertheless, others argue that genetic enhancement through HGE could be possible in the near future (de Araujo, 2017 Editing the genome of human beings: CRISPR-Cas9 and the ethics of genetic enhancement. More specifically, some authors consider HGE a positive step towards allowing humans the opportunity to obtain beneficial traits that otherwise would not be achievable through human reproduction, thus providing a more radical interference in human life to overcome human limitations (de Araujo, 2017 Editing the genome of human beings: CRISPR-Cas9 and the ethics of genetic enhancement."
