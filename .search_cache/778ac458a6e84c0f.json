      "content": "Among the earliest and most widely used techniques is GUIDE-seq (genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing)4,5, which integrates double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides at CRISPR-induced breaks to map off-target sites across the genome. DISCOVER-seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-targets and verification by sequencing)7 offers another layer of insight by capturing DNA-protein interactions that occur during CRISPR-induced breaks. Originating from academic research, Broken String\u2019s work led to the development of INDUCE-seq\u00ae, an NGS-based platform that enables high-precision measurement of CRISPR off-target effects25. Dobbs noted that INDUCE-seq offers several advantages over alternative methods for detecting CRISPR off-target effects. GUIDE-seq enables genome-wide profiling of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas nucleases. Digenome-seq: genome-wide profiling of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects in human cells. Tracking-seq reveals the heterogeneity of off-target effects in CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated genome editing. Off-Target Analysis in Gene Editing and Applications for Clinical Translation of CRISPR/Cas9 in HIV-1 Therapy. Genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction and optimization using RNA-DNA interaction fingerprints. Off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing."
