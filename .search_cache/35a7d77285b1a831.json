View a PDF of the paper titled Comparing the Overhead of Topological and Concatenated Quantum Error Correction, by Martin Suchara and 5 other authors. > Abstract:This work compares the overhead of quantum error correction with concatenated and topological quantum error-correcting codes. First, topological quantum error correction requires fewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated codes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately 10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be chosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and superconducting qubits. | Subjects: | Quantum Physics (quant-ph) |. | Cite as: | arXiv:1312.2316 [quant-ph] |. |  | (or  arXiv:1312.2316v1 [quant-ph] for this version) |.
