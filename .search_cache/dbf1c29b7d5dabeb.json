Due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and precise gene editing capabilities, CRISPR/Cas technology has emerged as a promising tool for treating diseases. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous physiopathological nature of diseases and variations in disease onset sites pose significant challenges for *in vivo* applications of CRISPR systems. The efficiency of CRISPR systems in disease treatment is directly influenced by the performance of the delivery system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of CRISPR systems, vector technologies, and their applications in disease treatment, while also addressing the challenges encountered in clinical settings. ## Graphical abstract. This review summarizes CRISPR/Cas systems' development and their therapeutic applications across diseases using advanced delivery strategies. :   Peer review under the responsibility of Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
