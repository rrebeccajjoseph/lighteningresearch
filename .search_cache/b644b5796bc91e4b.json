      "content": "# Shifting Perceptions of CRISPR From Controversial Gene Editing Tool to Indispensable SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance Tool. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the broad potential applications of CRISPR have extended beyond gene editing. Yet, there is also an underlying assumption that gene editing for therapeutic purposes would be a good use of CRISPR. As cell and gene therapies move to market treating a small number of people with rare genetic diseases, public perceptions of these technologies are already shifting and may shift more over time. CRISPR\u2019s application as a diagnostic testing tool is different from its gene-editing use.
