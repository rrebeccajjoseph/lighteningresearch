      "title": "Scaling Performance of Large Language Model Pretraining - arXiv",
      "content": "Training these models is an extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive datasets. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully leveraging available GPU compute capacity. The size of our dataset leads to our first roadblock in scaling training - sharing 2 TB of data across hundreds of nodes in a supercomputing environment can have considerable performance impacts."
