      "content": "Multiple technical routes, including ultra-high nickel and lithium-rich manganese-based cathodes, silicon carbon anodes, and sulfide/oxide electrolytes, achieved breakthroughs in parallel, with planned capacity already reaching tens of GWh. Automaker-driven prototype verifications are being conducted intensively, and the industry is transitioning from R&D to pilot-scale mass production. This report systematically reviews key industry chain developments in January, provides in-depth analysis of progress in cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and battery projects, and aims to reveal the internal logic and core challenges as solid-state batteries advance from technological breakthroughs to scaled commercial application, while offering forward-looking judgments for 2026\u2014a critical year for verification and differentiation. Yixing Canmax (controlled by Canmax) invested 1.12 billion yuan to build a mass production line with an annual capacity of 5,200 mt of high-nickel ternary cathode material for solid-state batteries, of which a 200 mt pilot line is already in operation, indicating that upstream segments of the industry chain are actively advancing laboratory achievements toward scaled production."

      "content": "# Solid-state batteries: why mass production won\u2019t happen before 2027 (and who\u2019s leading the global race). Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise energy densities of 300\u2013500 Wh/kg, doubling the capacity of today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries (150\u2013250 Wh/kg). * Solid Power (USA) is developing sulfide-based SSBs. Partnered with Ford and BMW, with pilot production operational. * CATL is advancing sulfide-based SSBs, targeting small-scale production of its all-solid-state battery by 2027. * Geely has achieved 400 Wh/kg in its all-solid-state battery and completed development of 20Ah cells. * In 2023, Samsung SDI completed the world's biggest pilot production line for solid-state batteries. * LG Energy Solution is working on polymer-oxide and sulfide SSBs, aiming for mass production post-2030\u200b. * SK On is developing hybrid oxide and sulfide SSBs, with a pilot plant launching by 2025\u200b and mass production by 2029. Hyundai aims to begin mass-producing all-solid-state batteries around 2030. * LG Energy Solution has developed a technology that can increase the charging speed of solid-state batteries - **link**."
