      "content": "\u2022 Creating dedicated collaboration platforms could facilitate inclusive engagement in commercialisation of QTs. These platforms could serve as a space for networking, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among various stakeholders, including researchers, industry experts, entrepreneurs, and investors. o Frameworks should be adaptable and responsive and address the potential risks and security concerns associated with the misuse of QTs. o Build collaboration and cooperation among countries and governments to establish international standards, share information, and develop common guidelines for the responsible use and transfer of QTs;. Effective governance can ensure responsible use and security in the development and deployment of QTs. Addressing the risks of dual-use technology , promoting international collaboration, and overcoming governance challenges require a focus on ethical principles and global cooperation. Balancing openness with strategic goals ensures the positive impact of commercialisation of QTs. Road to 2035: The journey to 2035 involves establishing clear policy frameworks for the development and transfer of QTs. International cooperation is paramount, emphasising the need for collaborative efforts among countries to set standards and guidelines."

      "content": "# 7 Quantum Computing Trends That Will Shape Industries in 2026. Quantum computing is finally stepping out of research labs and into the real world. As we approach 2026, several clear trends are emerging that will define how quantum computing is actually used. Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are converging into a powerful new field often referred to as **Quantum AI**. Quantum computers won\u2019t replace classical systems overnight \u2014 and they don\u2019t need to. Quantum computing is shaping up to be the next competitive frontier for cloud platforms, much like AI and GPUs were in recent years. 2026 is shaping up to be a turning point for quantum computing \u2014 not because the technology is fully mature, but because organizations are finally learning how to use it effectively. The organizations that start building quantum literacy today, experiment with hybrid systems, and prepare their security infrastructure early will be best positioned to unlock the real value of quantum computing when it truly scales."
