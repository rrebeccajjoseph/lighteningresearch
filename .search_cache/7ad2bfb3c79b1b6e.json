      "content": "# Quantum Error Correction: Surface code vs. The first was Rainer Blatt's group, who used trapped ions to perform a *topologically encoded* qubit using \"color code\": Quantum computations on a topologically encoded qubit (arxiv). The other one was John Martinis' group, who used superconducting qubits and performed a simplified version of a \"surface code\": State preservation by repetitive error detection in a superconducting quantum circuit (arxiv). The Martinis group has shown recently that they are above the threshold for surface-code QEC arxiv. Are there other groups who have the same level of control over their systems to perform multi-qubits quantum error-correction codes? * $\\begingroup$ I'm no experimentalist, but this paper here: arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5738v1.pdf suggests that the color codes might sometimes have better thresholds, but maybe they are just similar. The color code and surface code are very similar. The Rainer Blatt group demonstrated the smallest possible color-code which also uses 7 qubits (this instance is also referred to as the Steane code)."
