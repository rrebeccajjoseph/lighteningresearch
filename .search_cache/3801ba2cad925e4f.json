      "content": "The scientific world experienced a watershed moment in late 2023 when the U.S. FDA approved Casgevy, the first CRISPR gene therapy to treat patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. For the first time in human history, a therapy powered by CRISPR gene editing transformed a chronic genetic disorder into a treatable, and potentially curable, condition. Unlike earlier gene-editing technologies that required designing custom DNA-cutting enzymes for each target sequence, CRISPR works with a guide RNA and a protein called Cas9. Beyond blood disorders, CRISPR gene editing addresses rare genetic conditions previously considered hopeless. CRISPR-edited CAR-T cell therapies for cancer eliminate checkpoint inhibitors that allow tumors to evade immune detection, potentially extending survival in patients with otherwise resistant cancers. In-vivo CRISPR therapies, those administered directly to patients rather than editing cells in the laboratory, are under investigation for transthyretin amyloidosis, a protein-misfolding disease affecting the heart and nerves. As CRISPR gene editing matures, the fundamental nature of medical practice may shift from chronic disease management to genetic correction at the source."
