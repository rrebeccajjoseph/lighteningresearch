      "content": "Unlike prior surveys [57, 34\u201348 (2024)\"), 65\"), 249, pages 15762\u201315782, (2023)\")], which primarily focus on fairness within specific subdomains (e.g., information retrieval or model compression), in this survey, we aim to investigate ethical issues in the development of LLMs and propose a new taxonomy to help readers better understand the ethical issues and corresponding techniques that are proposed to solve these issues. * We systematically summarize and categorize existing ethical issues into two main categories: 1) we discuss **longstanding** problems of data privacy, copyright, and fairness; 2) we investigate **new-emerging** problems that are pertinent to LLMs, including truthfulness and social norms, and further discuss the design and requirement of law and regulatory compliance in guiding future explorations.

      "content": "Just like the mortgage model, large language models (LLMs) influence critical decisions, and training them on biased data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, exclude marginalized voices, or even generate unsafe recommendations. By focusing on measurable solutions: differential privacy techniques to protect user data, bias-mitigation benchmarks to identify gaps, and reproducible tracking with tools like neptune.ai to ensure accountability. You can use tools like neptune.ai to track bias metrics (e.g., fairness or disparate impact) across model versions. Opt-out mechanisms allow users to control whether their data is used to train AI models and other software, giving them some agency over how their data is processed and used. * **Protect user privacy from start to finish**: Think less about the mathematical structure of your model (that is usually handled by the provider, they will keep it law-compliant) and more about how data is handled in practice during your model\u2019s lifecycle (this is where you are responsible to keep your system law-compliant)."
