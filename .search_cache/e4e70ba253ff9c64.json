      "content": "# The Rise of Solid-State Battery in Electric Vehicles. **Solid-state battery technology claims to charge batteries faster, hold more energy, and be safer.** Global companies like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota are investing heavily in this new idea. Today, nearly every major automaker is racing to commercialize solid-state battery technology, which could change how electric vehicles are designed, powered, and used. ## When will solid-state battery EVs be available? Experts in the industry anticipate that the initial solid-state battery electric vehicles may be available by 2027 or 2028, beginning with high-end and hybrid models. In the next ten years, solid-state battery technology may become the norm in most electric vehicles. ## What is a Solid-State Battery? ### What is a solid-state battery made of? Bulk solid-state batteries use thicker solid electrolytes, offering high energy storage suited for electric vehicles, though they\u2019re harder to manufacture consistently. ## Solid-State Battery vs. In terms of performance and safety, solid-state batteries are better, but lithium-ion batteries are still cheaper and easier to locate."

      "content": "Its entry-level versions get lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, but it\u2019s also available with a 133 kWh semi-solid-state pack that\u2019s good for more than 620 miles of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle (CLTC). In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial\u2019s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. ## Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries. The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. However, we\u2019re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Toyota said it still plans to become the world's first automaker to incorporate all-solid-state batteries into EVs. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house."

      "content": ":   Scientists in South Korea have discovered a way to make all-solid-state batteries safer and more powerful using inexpensive materials. Professor Dong-Hwa Seo explained the broader significance of the work, saying, \"Through this research, we have presented a design principle that can simultaneously improve the cost and performance of all-solid-state batteries using cheap raw materials. June 12, 2023 \u0097 Solid-state batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes, unlike the more commonly known lithium-ion batteries, which use liquid electrolytes. Mar. 7, 2022 \u0097 A new study tackled a long-held assumption that adding some liquid electrolyte to improve performance would make solid-state batteries unsafe. A New Solid-State Battery Surprises the Researchers Who Created It. Sep. May 12, 2021 \u0097 Researchers have designed a stable, lithium-metal solid state battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times -- far more cycles than have been previously demonstrated --- at a high ..."
