      "content": "Conceptually, to use a quantum error-correcting code, one can append ancilla qubits \"Ancilla (quantum computing)\") to qubits that need protection, and apply a unitary encoding circuit to rotate the global state into a subspace of a larger Hilbert space. Surface codes are pivotal for scalable quantum error correction in 2025, enabling below-threshold logical qubits with improved fidelity in superconducting systems. * In 2021, an entangling gate between two logical qubits encoded in topological quantum error-correction codes has first been realized using 10 ions in a trapped-ion quantum computer. * In April 2024, researchers at Microsoft claimed to have successfully tested a quantum error correction code that allowed them to achieve an error rate with logical qubits that is 800 times better than the underlying physical error rate. | Quantum error correction | * Codes   + 5 qubit   + CSS   + GKP   + quantum convolutional   + stabilizer   + Shor   + Bacon\u2013Shor   + Steane   + Toric   + *gnu* * Entanglement-assisted |."

By identifying the dominant error mechanisms that limit quantum error correction performance, our study highlights concrete targets for improving spin qubit hardware and provides a path toward scalable fault-tolerant architectures. | Subjects: | Quantum Physics (quant-ph) |. | Cite as: | arXiv:2506.17190 [quant-ph] |. |  | (or  arXiv:2506.17190v1 [quant-ph] for this version) |.
