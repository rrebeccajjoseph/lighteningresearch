Majorana 1, the eight-qubit topological quantum processor unveiled at Microsoft Station Q's 2025 conference. **In a leap forward for quantum computing, a Microsoft team led by UC Santa Barbara physicists on Wednesday unveiled an eight-qubit topological quantum processor, the first of its kind. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of stuff that we\u2019ve been keeping under wraps that we\u2019re dropping all at once now,\u201d said\u00a0Microsoft Station Q\u00a0Director\u00a0Chetan Nayak, a professor of physics at UC Santa Barbara and a Technical Fellow for Quantum Hardware at Microsoft. At eight qubits, the researchers\u2019 topological processor is a mere embryo in the world of quantum computers, but marks a major milestone in the scientists\u2019 decades-long quest to develop a topological quantum computer. Along the way, Nayak said, there have been fruitful partnerships between Station Q and the university, especially in the realm of creating the materials that host topological quantum behaviors."

      "content": "With major tech companies and startups actively working to improve performance, reduce error rates, and expand qubit counts, the development of quantum computer chips is a key focus in the global tech industry. ## What Are Quantum Chips? Quantum chips use superposition to allow qubits to exist in multiple states (0 and 1) at the same time, making it possible to carry out parallel computation. As a result, quantum chips can perform complex calculations that scale exponentially with more qubits. Quantum chips work by manipulating quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in a superposition of states\u2014unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1. Quantum chips control and measure qubit states using precise microwave pulses, lasers, or magnetic fields. ### Who makes quantum computing chips? Several leading companies and research institutions are developing quantum computing chips. Yes, Google has developed a real quantum chip named Sycamore, which uses 53 superconducting qubits. Quantum chips use qubits, which can exist in superposition and entanglement, allowing them to process multiple possibilities at once."
