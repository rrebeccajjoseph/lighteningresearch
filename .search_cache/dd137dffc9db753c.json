      "content": "Understanding the basics of quantum error correction and fault tolerance. When the field of quantum computing started to take off after Peter Shor's 1994 discovery of a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, a natural question arose: could we somehow use error correcting codes to protect *qubits* from errors, so that quantum computations could be made more resilient against noise? And of course, we don't just want to \u201cprotect\u201d quantum information using quantum error correcting codes; we also want to perform *computations* on logical qubits. As it turns out, some operations are easier to perform on encoded quantum information than others, and which operations are easy and which are hard can depend on the quantum error correcting code we choose. The idea is that certain operations on encoded quantum information can be performed in a fault-tolerant way \u2014 meaning that they can be done with unreliable components without magnifying the error rate and spoiling the computation \u2014 provided that we have additional qubits initialized to these very special states."

The surface code is a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation, achieving a high threshold error rate with nearest-neighbor gates in two spatial dimensions. We observe thresholds between 0.502(1)% and 1.140(1)% per gate, values which are generally lower than previous estimates.

      "content": "The most established fault tolerance framework uses quantum error correcting codes and decoders. The theory of quantum error correction has recently produced codes with optimal parameters that could potentially reduce the resource overhead of fault tolerance. The protocol achieves superdense coding gain over comparable classical baselines for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, recovers as special cases the state of art results for various other quantum PIR settings previously studied in the literature, and paves the way for applications in quantum coded distributed computation, where CSA code structures are important for communication efficiency, while security and resilience to stragglers and Byzantine servers are critical. Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical n,k,d\u2265m+1 binary linear code with certain additional properties, we show that pure [n,k,m+1]]2 quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) can be constructed within the codeword stabilized (CWS) code framework. We show that the proposed generalization contains a family of asymptotically good quantum codes that are based on non-Cayley Schreier graphs, i.e., a new family of (generalized) quantum Tanner codes is provided."
