      "content": "# The Rise of Solid-State Battery in Electric Vehicles. **Solid-state battery technology claims to charge batteries faster, hold more energy, and be safer.** Global companies like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota are investing heavily in this new idea. Today, nearly every major automaker is racing to commercialize solid-state battery technology, which could change how electric vehicles are designed, powered, and used. ## When will solid-state battery EVs be available? Experts in the industry anticipate that the initial solid-state battery electric vehicles may be available by 2027 or 2028, beginning with high-end and hybrid models. In the next ten years, solid-state battery technology may become the norm in most electric vehicles. ## What is a Solid-State Battery? ### What is a solid-state battery made of? Bulk solid-state batteries use thicker solid electrolytes, offering high energy storage suited for electric vehicles, though they\u2019re harder to manufacture consistently. ## Solid-State Battery vs. In terms of performance and safety, solid-state batteries are better, but lithium-ion batteries are still cheaper and easier to locate.",

In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial\u2019s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. ## Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries. The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. However, we\u2019re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Toyota said it still plans to become the world's first automaker to incorporate all-solid-state batteries into EVs. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house.",

For the first time in human history, a therapy powered by CRISPR gene editing transformed a chronic genetic disorder into a treatable, and potentially curable, condition. Unlike earlier gene-editing technologies that required designing custom DNA-cutting enzymes for each target sequence, CRISPR works with a guide RNA and a protein called Cas9. Beyond blood disorders, CRISPR gene editing addresses rare genetic conditions previously considered hopeless. CRISPR-edited CAR-T cell therapies for cancer eliminate checkpoint inhibitors that allow tumors to evade immune detection, potentially extending survival in patients with otherwise resistant cancers. In-vivo CRISPR therapies, those administered directly to patients rather than editing cells in the laboratory, are under investigation for transthyretin amyloidosis, a protein-misfolding disease affecting the heart and nerves.

Such a result reveals that language models can be effectively aligned via a small number of carefully chosen examples, *thus emphasizing the role of data quality and diversity in training and aligning powerful language models*.

Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully leveraging available GPU compute capacity. The size of our dataset leads to our first roadblock in scaling training - sharing 2 TB of data across hundreds of nodes in a supercomputing environment can have considerable performance impacts.",

Quantum error correction delivers the mathematical foundation for optimism that errors can be overcome and large-scale quantum computing realized.  Nonetheless, a substantial gap lies between the mathematical promise of quantum error correction and the practical matter of delivering quantum computers with improved performance.\n\nIn this talk we address this challenge holistically, focusing on the various ways that quantum control infrastructure software can make error-robust quantum computing a practical reality by deterministically suppressing hardware errors.\n\nWe frame our discussion around experimental demonstrations on commercial IBM quantum computers that achieve up to 9,000x enhancements in QED-C algorithmic benchmarks and quantum volume measurements with no changes to the underlying hardware.

CRISPR/Cas9 is a targeted genome editing technology that uses the Cas protein from certain species of bacteria and archaea. Due to the possibility of off-target effects with no way to definitively prevent them, CRISPR\u2019s use in human clinical research has been heavily set back making it nearly impossible to continue progress until this issue has been addressed. CRISPR works by targeting certain sequences of DNA and manually editing them to cure certain diseases, but off-target effects happen when other sequences are unintentionally changed causing major complications (Guo et al., 2023). Fortunately, through continued research, these problems are being solved through new developments like *in silico* tools which can find off-target effects and improved viral delivery services that prevent continued gene editing.

However, based on the limited evidence, CRISPR/Cas9 was likely used to target this gene, but rather than replicate the naturally observed and beneficial 32-base deletion, the edits merely induced DSBs at one end of the deletion, allowing NHEJ to repair the damaged DNA while introducing random, uncharacterized mutations.",

By utilizing a programmable RNA protein complex to introduce targeted double-strand breaks, the CRISPR-Cas system enables the correction of pathogenic mutations and the modulation of gene function with unprecedented efficiency. In this review, we first outline the molecular architecture and mechanistic basis of CRISPR-Cas9 and then consider its latest applications in modeling, drug screening, small-molecule-mediated editing, and treating hereditary, autoimmune, and oncological diseases. Emphasis is placed on the generation of disease-relevant cellular and animal models and on the potential of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene therapy to address hitherto intractable disorders. Finally, we discuss current challenges including off-target activity, gene editing efficiency, delivery constraints, and immunogenicity and highlight emerging strategies to overcome these hurdles and broaden the clinical impact of CRISPR-Cas systems.

First, topological quantum error correction requires fewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated codes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately 10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be chosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and superconducting qubits. | Subjects: | Quantum Physics (quant-ph) |. | Cite as: | arXiv:1312.2316 [quant-ph] |. |  | (or  arXiv:1312.2316v1 [quant-ph] for this version) |.

      "content": "# Quantum Error Correction Achieves 99.9% Fidelity Using Surface Codes. January 27, 2026 by Rohail\u00a0T. Researchers at Google Quantum AI have achieved a significant milestone in quantum error correction by demonstrating surface codes on superconducting quantum processors. Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires robust mechanisms to detect and correct errors arising from decoherence and operational noise. The experimental results showed logical error rates as low as 10\u207b\u2074 per correction cycle, significantly below the commonly accepted fault-tolerance threshold of 10\u207b\u00b3. This work provides compelling evidence that scalable quantum error correction is achievable on superconducting platforms. By operating below the critical error threshold, the demonstrated approach offers a clear pathway toward practical fault-tolerant quantum computation. Future efforts will focus on scaling to larger surface codes and integrating error-corrected logical qubits with quantum algorithms, bringing fully functional quantum computers closer to reality. \ud83d\uddde *Quantum Error Correction with Surface Codes on Superconducting Processors*.
