      "content": "# The Rise of Solid-State Battery in Electric Vehicles. **Solid-state battery technology claims to charge batteries faster, hold more energy, and be safer.** Global companies like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota are investing heavily in this new idea. Today, nearly every major automaker is racing to commercialize solid-state battery technology, which could change how electric vehicles are designed, powered, and used. ## When will solid-state battery EVs be available? Experts in the industry anticipate that the initial solid-state battery electric vehicles may be available by 2027 or 2028, beginning with high-end and hybrid models. In the next ten years, solid-state battery technology may become the norm in most electric vehicles. ## What is a Solid-State Battery? ### What is a solid-state battery made of? Bulk solid-state batteries use thicker solid electrolytes, offering high energy storage suited for electric vehicles, though they\u2019re harder to manufacture consistently. ## Solid-State Battery vs. In terms of performance and safety, solid-state batteries are better, but lithium-ion batteries are still cheaper and easier to locate.",

In August, the automaker said the commercial production of the semi-solid-state battery would begin in 2026. Earlier this year, the automaker showcased a prototype EQS equipped with Factorial\u2019s semi-solid-state battery, claiming it could deliver 25% more range without increasing the size or the weight of the pack. ## Automakers With Plans To Launch Solid-State Batteries. The automaker claims that its solid-state battery will deliver more than 620 miles of range. However, we\u2019re likely to see a solid-state battery in a Toyota hybrid before an EV. Toyota said it still plans to become the world's first automaker to incorporate all-solid-state batteries into EVs. Like Toyota and Honda, Nissan is also working on solid-state batteries in-house.",

For the first time in human history, a therapy powered by CRISPR gene editing transformed a chronic genetic disorder into a treatable, and potentially curable, condition. Unlike earlier gene-editing technologies that required designing custom DNA-cutting enzymes for each target sequence, CRISPR works with a guide RNA and a protein called Cas9. Beyond blood disorders, CRISPR gene editing addresses rare genetic conditions previously considered hopeless. CRISPR-edited CAR-T cell therapies for cancer eliminate checkpoint inhibitors that allow tumors to evade immune detection, potentially extending survival in patients with otherwise resistant cancers. In-vivo CRISPR therapies, those administered directly to patients rather than editing cells in the laboratory, are under investigation for transthyretin amyloidosis, a protein-misfolding disease affecting the heart and nerves.

Such a result reveals that language models can be effectively aligned via a small number of carefully chosen examples, *thus emphasizing the role of data quality and diversity in training and aligning powerful language models*.

      "content": "Training these models is an extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive datasets. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully leveraging available GPU compute capacity. The size of our dataset leads to our first roadblock in scaling training - sharing 2 TB of data across hundreds of nodes in a supercomputing environment can have considerable performance impacts.",
